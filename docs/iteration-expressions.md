# Iteration Expressions
## The `while` Statement
#### Structure
- The `while` statement is used to conditionally and repetitively execute a block of code
- The `while` statement is followed by a condition
- The condition must evaluate to a boolean expression
- The condition is optionally followed by a `loop tag`
- The condition is followed by a block of code
- The block of code is executed if the condition evaluates to `true`
- The block of code is optional -- ie can be `{}`

#### Example:
```s++
while x < y {
    do_something(x, y);
};
```
